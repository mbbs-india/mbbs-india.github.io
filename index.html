											• The problem of infectious disease in Kyrgyzstan<br>
											• The disease of HIV in Kyrgyzstan<br>
											Two assistants of the department defended of thesis: “A method for treating of the deep corneal defects” (assistant Asanova AA., Ophthalmology, 2008) and “The Formation of stable non cannula tracheostomy with difficult access to the cervical spine respiratory tract.” (assistant Orozaliev AM, Otolaryngology, 2011). Methods of treatment in these works were implement into the practical work of the National Hospital of Kyrgyz Republic.</p>
										<p>Currently the assistant Asanova A.A. is preparing to defend the doctoral thesis “Methods of treating the syndrome limbal cell deficiency.”</p>
										<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Cooperation with students</em></strong></p>
										<p>Together with the students was carried out research work, “Clinical supervision of viral hepatitis A in adults.” The studies were conducted over several months. These studies were published in an article in the journal “Science and New Technologies» (April 2009)</p>
										<p>Also curatorial work with students carry out, to organized of the leisure of students, familiarization tours in the country, the organization of holidays, familiarity with the culture of Kyrgyzstan.</p>
										<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Publications</em></strong></p>
										<p>During its existence the department has been published over 100 scientific articles in national journals, journals of the near and far abroad, 10 workbooks for medical students and doctors. To remake of the curriculums for all disciplines, to updated the test material.</p>
										<p><strong><em>Conference and International Cooperation</em></strong></p>
										<p>Employees of the department continuously and actively participate in international cooperation.</p>

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">With the International students coming in a new place, it is really a hard task to find a place of living. ISM has taken care of this by owning its own Dormitory for both Girls and Boys. With the count not exceeding four per a well-furnished and spacious room, it is more than sufficient for the happy living of a student. With the University Canteen located nearby, students do not even need to worry about their food.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">Special workers have been appointed in order to maintain cleanliness in the hostel rooms, corridors, premises, toilets and bathrooms. At present two floors has been allotted to the Pakistani students, three floors to Indian students.</p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">A female warden is responsible for the safety of the girl students in the hostel. The entrance and exit of the hostel has an extra inner gate to ensure extra security and safety of the students. A representative of the ISM Student’s Parliament, i.e. the Senator for Hostel Affairs also resides in this hostel, helps students with their problems, and assists them whenever required. Each hostel floor has a set of toilets and bathrooms that have a regular cold and hot water supply. The student is allowed to enter the hostel premises until 9:00 pm and it is well guarded with police security.</p>
