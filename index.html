		<!--<p style="text-align: justify;">With the International students coming in a new place, it is really a hard task to find a place of living. ISM has taken care of this by owning its own Dormitory for both Girls and Boys. With the count not exceeding four per a well-furnished and spacious room, it is more than sufficient for the happy living of a student. With the University Canteen located nearby, students do not even need to worry about their food.</p>-->
		<!--<p style="text-align: justify;">Special workers have been appointed in order to maintain cleanliness in the hostel rooms, corridors, premises, toilets and bathrooms. At present two floors has been allotted to the Pakistani students, three floors to Indian students.</p>-->
		<!--<p style="text-align: justify;">A female warden is responsible for the safety of the girl students in the hostel. The entrance and exit of the hostel has an extra inner gate to ensure extra security and safety of the students. A representative of the ISM Student’s Parliament, i.e. the Senator for Hostel Affairs also resides in this hostel, helps students with their problems, and assists them whenever required. Each hostel floor has a set of toilets and bathrooms that have a regular cold and hot water supply. The student is allowed to enter the hostel premises until 9:00 pm and it is well guarded with police security.</p>-->
